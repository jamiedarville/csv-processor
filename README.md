# CSV Processor for Server Data

This Python script processes a CSV file containing server information to generate three summary reports: a count of unique operating systems, a count of unique hostnames, and a count of unique vulnerabilities.

This was created for dealing with CSV reports from Qualys to strip down only relevant data and be able to create custom reports easier.

## üìú Description

The primary purpose of this tool is to provide a quick and easy way to get high-level summaries from a server data export. It reads a CSV file, extracts specific columns for hostnames, operating systems, and vulnerabilities, and then outputs three separate, timestamped CSV files with the aggregated data. This is particularly useful for system administrators, security analysts, or anyone needing a quick overview of their server fleet's composition and security posture.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* Pandas library

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/jamiedarville/csv-processor.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

You can run the script from the command line, optionally providing the input file path and an output directory. The script defaults to using a file named `input_data.csv` in the same directory.

**Basic Usage**
```bash
python csv_processor.py
```

**Specifying an Input File**
```bash
python csv_processor.py /path/to/your/server_data.csv
```

**Specifying an Input File and Output Directory**
```bash
python csv_processor.py /path/to/your/server_data.csv /path/to/save/reports/
```

The script expects the input CSV to have data in at least these columns:
* **Column C (index 2):** Hostnames
* **Column E (index 4):** Operating Systems
* **Column H (index 7):** Vulnerabilities

## üìÑ Output Files

The script will generate three CSV files in the specified output directory (or the input file's directory by default). Each filename is timestamped to prevent overwriting previous reports.

* `os_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`: A summary of the counts of each unique operating system.
* `hostname_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`: A summary of the counts of each unique hostname.
* `vuln_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`: A summary of the counts of each unique vulnerability.

## üíª Installation on MacOS and Windows

### MacOS

1.  **Install Python:** The recommended way to install Python on MacOS is using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew, you can install it from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2.  **Install Python using Homebrew:**

    ```bash
    brew install python3
    ```

3.  **Verify Installation:**

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

### Windows

1.  **Download Python:** Go to the official Python website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.

2.  **Run the Installer:**

    *   Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.

3.  **Verify Installation:**

    *   Open a command prompt (cmd) and type:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

### Running the script

1.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    *   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `csv-processor.py` file.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

    *   Activate the virtual environment:

        *   **On MacOS:**

            ```bash
            source env/bin/activate
            ```

        *   **On Windows:**

            ```bash
            .\env\Scripts\activate
            ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python csv_processor.py input_data.csv output_directory
    ```

    *   Replace `input_data.csv` with the path to your CSV file.
    *   Replace `output_directory` with the path to the directory where you want to save the reports. If you don't specify an output directory, the reports will be saved in the same directory as the script.
